A Free SEO Tool from George Andrews to the SEO Community

For about a year now, I've been working on and off on a project to make a WordPress Plugin that lets you see Mozscape API information about your posts and pages as you are editing them.

This extension includes Mozscape API data for each of your WordPress-driven website's Pages and Posts.

Now you can review Mozscape data for posts and pages while you edit them in real-time.

4 Easy Steps:
1. Download
2. Install
3. Add your Mozscape API Credentials
4. Review Mozscape Data for all your Posts and Pages
